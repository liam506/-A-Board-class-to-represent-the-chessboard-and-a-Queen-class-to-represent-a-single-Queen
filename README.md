# -A-Board-class-to-represent-the-chessboard-and-a-Queen-class-to-represent-a-single-Queen
A Board object could be represented in a number of ways. The most intuitive representation might be a two-dimensional array; however, such an array wastes space because only eight squares out of 64 are used. Instead we will use an STL vector that contains the 8 Queens. Each Queen will be stored in the position of the vector that corresponds to the Queen's column (i.e., the Queen in column 0 will be stored in position 0 of the vector, the Queen in column 1 will be stored in position 1 of the vector, and so on). Since each Queen will know its own location on the board, this vector will fully specify the state of the board.
